<p>In order to provide—on average—the most current medical care doctors are
advised to align their clinical practice with the results of well-conducted
clinical trials, or the aggregation of the results from multiple such trials
[Greenfield 2007]. This approach implicitly assumes that all patients eligible
for treatment similarly experience the benefits and harms of treatment as the
reference trial population. Therefore, at a certain point, the accurate
estimation of these average effects became crucial for guiding medical practice,
transforming clinical trials from tools for assessing causality into tools for
predicting patient-level treatment effects [ref]. When the strong positive
overall effects derived from clinical trials could not be achieved in medical
practice, the problem was attributed to the reference trial population being too
narrow and not representing the “average” patient requiring treatment. It is
often the case that older patients or patients with comorbidities or receiving
multiple medications are not well represented in many clinical trials. Therefore
the need for more pragmatic clinical trials incorporating broad patient
populations was highlighted [Treweek, Trials 2009; …].</p>
<p>The wider clinical trial populations ensure that overall results will be
generalizable to “real-life” patients. However, generalizability comes at a
cost: wider range of included patients means higher variability of measured
characteristics, therefore higher variability in disease severity is observed,
which, in turn, translates to higher variability of observed treatment effect
sizes. In short, the estimated treatment effect derived from such clinical
trials is often an average of heterogeneous treatment effects and, as such, may
not be applicable to most patient subgroups. This means that a positive average
treatment effect estimated from a clinical trial very often is only evidence
that some of the enrollees benefitted from the intervention under study. If,
however, the intervention is linked to a serious adverse event, treating
everyone would result in serious harms for many patients, despite the positive
overall effect.</p>
<p>Conceptually, heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE) is the variation of
treatment effects on the individual level within the target population
[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0887-378X.2004.00327.x" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0887-378X.2004.00327.x</a>]. As individual treatment
effects—difference between outcomes under all possible treatment assignments
within the same individual—are the ones generating HTE, its identification
and quantification is crucial for guiding medical decision making and lies at
the core of patient-centered outcomes research. Despite HTE being widely
anticipated, however, its evaluation is not straightforward. Individual
treatment effects are—by their nature—unobservable: the moment a
patient receives a specific treatment, their response under the alternatives
becomes unmeasurable (fundamental problem of causal inference).</p>
<p>To “glimpse” at a specific individual’s response under alternative treatments,
researchers usually observe the outcomes of other “similar” patients that
actually received one of the other candidate treatments. However, patient
similarity is not straightforward to assess. Patients differ in a vast number of
characterstics that make them unique and may or may not be relevant to modifying
treatment responses. Identification of such patient characterstics can be quite
complicated. In clinical trials it usually relies on the detection of
statistically significant interactions of treatment with measured covariates
(subgroup analyses). However, as clinical trials are usually only adequately
powered to detect overall effects of a certain size, this kind of analyses can
be problematic. This is already widely known and research in subgroup analyses
has provided guidance on how these should be carried out [refs]. The lack of
statistical power often results in falsely concluding “consistency” of the
treatment effect across several subpopulations of interest or overestimating the
effect size of a treatment-covariate interaction. The former because an existing
interaction effect was smaller than the detectable effect size, the latter
because randomization did not achieve balance between the levels of the
subgrouping variable due to the small patient numbers.</p>
<p>Baseline risk, i.e. the patient’s true probability—given their measured
characteristics—of experiencing the outcome of interest without receiving the
treatment under study, is an important determinant of treatment effect
[refs]. It sets an upper bound on how large the treatment effect can be for
individuals of the same risk. Low risk patients can only experience minimal
treatment benefit before their risk is reduced to zero. On the contrary, high
risk patients can achieve much higher benefits. This means that baseline risk
can be used as a subgrouping variable for assessing HTE. For many common
settings prediction models of high quality for estimating baseline risk already
exist and can be directly applied to the data at hand [refs]. If no such models
exist, the researcher can develop one from the available dataset [refs]. An
important advantage of using baseline risk as the subgrouping variable is that
it, being a summary score (combination of the effects of multiple patient
characteristics), achieves higher power for detecting HTE as it divides the
population in much denser subpopulations compared to multiple-way subgroup
analyses based on the same patient characteristics.</p>
<p>Depending on the scale treatment effect is measured, HTE may or may not be
identified. For example, despite finding statistically significant subgroup effect
evaluated on the relative scale, the absolute risk difference between the two
groups may be so small that has no clinical relevance
[<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2013.11.003" class="uri">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2013.11.003</a>]. Therefore, in the presence
of a trully effective treatment, effect heterogeneity should always be
anticipated on some scale [Dahabreh, IJE 2016], as baseline risk is bound to
vary across trial patients. If true effect modifiers and their relationship with
the outcome were known and the available sample size provided adequate
statistical power for evaluating these interactions, then modeling
treatment-covariate interactions would be the optimal approach for assessing
HTE. However, this usually is not the case and prursuing this approach may lead
to overfitting and unstable estimates for the interaction effect sizes. In this
case the tradeoff of using a more stable but misspecified model (risk-based
subgrouping approach) can provide a valid alternative.</p>
<p>Healthcare data routinely collected by general practitioners, hospitals,
insurance companies, and many other private or public bodies is becoming
increasingly available giving researchers access to massive amounts of patient
data. Theoretically, the aforementioned statistical power challenges for the
evaluation of HTE would be largely mitigated if the analyses were performed on a
single observational database. However, as this data is not being accumulated
for research purposes, it suffers from many biases causing traditional inference
methods to fail. The issue is that observational data is not randomized. A
doctor prescribing a specific treatment expects—usually based on results from
clinical trials—that it will be beneficial for the patient they are
treating. This causes systematic differences in important characteristics among
patients receiving different treatments and renders their comparison very
untrustworthy.</p>
<p>If it can be assumed that all relevant patient characteristics on which the
treating physician based their decision have been captured in the observational
dataset, there are methods that can be used to account for these systematic
differences [refs]. Among the more popular ones is limiting the analyses
to the propensity score matched subpopulation. Propensity scores are the patient
probabilities of receiving the treatment under study and have been shown to have
the balancing property, i.e. conditional on the propensity score treatment
assignment is independent of the potential outcomes [refs]. This means that in a
subset of patients with equal propensity scores there are no differences in
covariate distributions of patients receiving the treatment under study compared
to those who are not. Consequently, patients within this subset can be assumed
to be randomized.</p>
<p>However, information captured in observational databases is fragmented depending
on the interests of the one gathering the data. Different patient
characteristics are captured—at different levels of detail—in a general
practitioner database, in a hospital medical record or in an administrative
claims database. Because of that, it cannot be certain that all the relevant
information used by the practioner is available within the data at hand. As
consequence, propensity score adjustment will not suffice to evaluate treatment
effects using the observational data, be it overall or subgroup effects.</p>
<p>Another important problem with observational databases is that they are not
compatible with each other. As anyone gathering routinely observed healthcare
data did so in a way that was more convenient to them, a plethora of structures
for the resulting databases arose. Diseases, treatments, medical exams and many
more aspects of healthcare are often coded differently in different
observational databases. This means that combining results from multiple
databases is not a simple task.</p>
<p>One of the solutions put forward for handling database incompatibility was the
creation of Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model
(OMOP-CDM) [refs]. This provided a standard for structuring an observational
database while large effort was put into developing processes for mapping
existing databases from their own specific structure to OMOP-CDM. A new level of
standardization and scalability for observational studies was reached. Common
definitions of diseases, treatments, and outcomes can now be applied uniformly
across a network of many databases containing information on hundreds of
millions of patients. An analysis plan can be executed following the exact same
steps across this network giving a more complete picture of the effect sizes
that can be estimated in different populations. The fragmented information
scattered across multiple databases can now be summarized in a consistent way to
give a fuller picture.</p>
